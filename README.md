This project is a demonstartion of some of my skills - a portfolio project of sorts. It is meant to be a restaurant rec machine: name a cuisine or a dish and a New York area, and the recommender will find the best place. While the data used for this project is essentially dummy data (it's too old and too sparse to be reliable), the issue this project solves is a real one - eliminating the analysis paralysis / decision fatigue involved in picking a place for your next food-related occasion. 

At the moment it is still a work in progress. 

Complete files: 
1. rest_data_exploration.ipynb - construction of a working dataset that will be used for enrichment and reccomendations; the notebook includes the full process from four seperate tables to the final product, including all the considerations that went into processing. The notebook concludes with some descritipve statistics about the working dataset. 

Work in Progress: 
1. cuisine_exploration.ipynb is a wip notebook, preparing for enriching the data for recommender using machine learning methods.
2.  item_prediction.ipynb - data enrichemnt using probabilistic methods.
3. recommener.ipynb - the actual recomendation engine. 


** working dataset - the dataset that will used for enrichment and recommendations.
