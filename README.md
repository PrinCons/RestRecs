This project is a demonstartion of some of my skills - a portfolio project of sorts. It is meant to be a restaurant rec machine: name a cuisine or a dish and a New York area, and the recommender will find the best place. 

At the moment it is still a work in progress. 
See rest_data_exploration.ipynb to see how the project started with four seperate datasets, merged into one usabale table that includes the features the recommender will use. 
cuisine_exploration.ipynb is a wip notebook, preparing for enriching the data for recommender using machine learning methods. 
In the future, the following notebooks will be added: 
1. item_prediction.ipynb - data enrichemnt using probabilistic methods.
2. recommener.ipynb - the actual recomendation engine.
